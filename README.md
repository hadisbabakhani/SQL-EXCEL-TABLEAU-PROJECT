Welcome to the repository for a comprehensive data analysis project showcasing the integration of SQL, Excel, and Tableau. This project demonstrated an end-to-end analytics workflow, from data preparation to visualization, using powerful tools and techniques.

Project Components
SQL Scripts: Prepared the dataset by querying multiple tables to gather valuable information about sales orders, customers, products, categories, stores, and sales staff.

Excel Files: Performed additional analysis and preprocessing to manipulate data, calculate key metrics, and uncover trends hidden within the numbers.

Tableau Visualizations: Explored visually compelling dashboards and interactive visualizations that brought the data to life, enabling effective communication of insights and data-driven decision-making.
